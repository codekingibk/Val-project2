      <h2>Dear Al-Ameen,</h2>

      <p>

        You're more than just a friend; you're family. Our bond is built on laughter, shared secrets, and unwavering support 

        and so much brotherly love. You celebrate my wins, pick me up when I fall, and always know how to make me smile, and I 

        can always confide in you.

      </p>

      <p>

        I cherish our long talks, our crazy discussions, and the comfort of knowing you're always there. This Valentine's Day, 

        I want to celebrate our friendship, a connection that's as strong and true as they come.

      </p>

      <p>

        Thank you for being you, for your infectious energy, and for your unwavering loyalty. You're the best friend anyone 

        could ask for, and I'm so lucky to have you in my life. Love you broski!

      </p>

      <p>Forever your bro,<br>Ademoyewa</p>
